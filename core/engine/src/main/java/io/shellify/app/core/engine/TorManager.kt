/**
 * Manages the Tor daemon lifecycle and exposes [torState] for UI observation.
 *
 * On-demand daemon: [ensureStarted] starts the Tor daemon when the first Tor-enabled app opens.
 * [releaseApp] schedules a shutdown after [GRACE_PERIOD_MS] when the last app without
 * preserveIdentity closes. Apps with preserveIdentity = true keep the daemon alive indefinitely.
 *
 * TorService is started with [startService] rather than [startForegroundService] so Android
 * does not enforce the 5-second [Service.startForeground] deadline — TorService promotes itself
 * to foreground once its native library finishes loading. Doze safety is preserved because
 * TorService holds a foreground notification for its entire lifetime (T-02-21).
 *
 * @param controlConnection injected for testability; defaults to null (production wires via
 *   TorService.getTorControlConnection() after STATUS_ON is received).
 * @param testScope optional coroutine scope for unit tests; production code uses an internal
 *   IO-dispatched scope.
